"The fastest way to get started with a documentation contribution is to "
"find something you want to change in the documentation. This might be a "
"typo or broken link, or something more extensive like revising or "
"expanding content. Once you've found a page you want to update, select "
"the edit option |edit-on-github| located in the top right corner of that "
