"A collaborative playbook is a checklist of the tasks that make up your "
"processes. Collaborative playbooks allow you to take codified knowledge "
"and processes and make them accessible and editable by your organization "
"and team. When you're setting up your playbook, you'll be able to break "
"tasks down, and assign actions to them - such as using a slash command to"
" start a Zoom call. You can also decide whether to use the same channel "
"every time your playbook is run, or a new one."
