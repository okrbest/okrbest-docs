"It's important to make it easy to start a run. One way to do this is by "
"setting up keywords. These keywords prompt a user to start the run when "
"they're used. In the incident response playbook, the keywords are "
"specific to critical incidents, for example ``sev-1`` and ``#incident``. "
"It's unlikely that someone would use those terms in general conversation "

"Tasks and checklists are the foundation of a template and a workflow. In "

"possible, so one of the first tasks is to add the on-call engineer to the"
