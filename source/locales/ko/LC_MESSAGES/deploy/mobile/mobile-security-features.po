"**OS sandboxing & app access isolation**: Mattermost’s data is confined "
"within its app-specific sandbox (see `Apple’s iOS sandboxing "
"<https://support.apple.com/guide/security/security-of-runtime-process-"
"sec15bfe098e/web>`_ and `Android’s sandboxing "
"<https://source.android.com/docs/security/app-sandbox>`_ guidelines). "
"This sandboxing mechanism ensures that all stored data—whether in the "
"SQLite databases, cached files, or logs—is isolated and inaccessible to "
"other applications. This is why TikTok, and any other application is "
"blocked from accessing Mattermost data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deploy/mobile/mobile-security-features.rst:69

"**iOS** employs a rigorous sandboxing model that relies on containerized "
"file systems and strict process isolation. Each app operates within its "
"own sandbox, with its home directory randomly assigned during "
"installation. As a result, data stored within the Mattermost app’s "
"sandbox directory remains accessible only to the app unless explicitly "
"shared by the user."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deploy/mobile/mobile-security-features.rst:71

"**Android** employs scoped storage by assigning each app its own Linux "
"user ID and a dedicated private directory. This model prevents other "
