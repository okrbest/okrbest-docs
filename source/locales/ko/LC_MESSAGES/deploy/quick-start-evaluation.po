"This guide provides instructions for quickly trying out Mattermost using "
"either Docker or Azure Marketplace. These options are ideal for testing "
"and evaluation purposes as they allow you to quickly get a Mattermost "
"instance up and running for exploration and testing. However, these quick"
" start options are not recommended for production use. They are "
"configured for demonstration purposes only."
