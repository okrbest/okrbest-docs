"Mattermost uses ``default_text_search_config`` for full-text search in "
"PostgresSQL databases, as opposed to a hardcoded text search config. "
"However, indexes are still created with a hardcoded text search config "
"(english) and as a result, full-text search may never use the indexes."

"These indexes need to be built against a specific language, and when "
