"The following diagrams detail suggested architecture configurations of "
":ref:`high availability Mattermost deployments <scale/high-availability-"
"cluster-based-deployment:deployment guide>` at different scales. Hardware"
" and infrastructure requirements will vary significantly based on usage "
"and policies. See the :doc:`scaling for enterprise </scale/scaling-for-"

"including hardware and infrastructure requirements."

"High availability in Mattermost consists of running redundant Mattermost "
"application servers, redundant database servers, and redundant load "
"balancers so that failure of any one of these components does not "
"interrupt operation of the system. Upon failure of one component, the "
"remaining application servers, database servers, and load balancers must "
"be sized and configured to carry the full load of the system. If this "
"requirement is not met, an outage of one component can result in an "
"overload of the remaining components, causing a complete system outage."

"Mattermost does not support high availability deployments spanning "
"multiple datacenters. All nodes in a high availability cluster must "
"reside within the same datacenter to ensure proper functionality and "
"performance."

"You can apply most configuration changes and dot release security updates"
" without interrupting service, provided that you update the system "
"components in the correct sequence. Changes to configuration settings "
"that require a server restart, and server version upgrades that involve a"
" change to the database schema, require a short period of downtime. "
"Downtime for a server restart is around 5 seconds. For a database schema "
"update, downtime can be up to 30 seconds."

"Mattermost is designed to be able to handle a large number of concurrent "
"users, and the architecture can be scaled up or down as needed. The "
"architecture is also designed to be flexible, allowing for the addition "
"of new components or services as needed. The following diagrams show the "
"recommended architecture for Mattermost deployments at 5,000, 10,000, "
"25,000, and 50,000 users. The diagrams are organized by user count and "
"include a general diagram and AWS and Azure versions of each diagram. See"
" the :doc:`scaling for enterprise </scale/scaling-for-enterprise>` "
"documentation for more information on scaling Mattermost deployments."
