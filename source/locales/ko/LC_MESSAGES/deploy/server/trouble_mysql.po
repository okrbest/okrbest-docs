"Before you can run the Mattermost server, you must first install and "
"configure a database. You can start Mattermost by navigating to the "
"``/opt/mattermost`` directory and entering the command ``sudo -u "
"mattermost bin/mattermost``. If the Mattermost server can't connect to "
"the database, it will fail to start. This section deals with MySQL "
"database issues that you may encounter when you start up Mattermost for "
"the first time."

"How you install MySQL varies depending upon which Linux distribution you "
