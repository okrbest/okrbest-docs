msgid "Why is Mattermost dropping support for MySQL?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deploy/postgres-migration.rst:26
msgid ""
"Mattermost has decided to drop support for MySQL databases to streamline "
"development and focus on delivering more efficient and optimized "
"features. By supporting only PostgreSQL, which is generally considered "
"more advanced and better-suited for enterprise environments, Mattermost "
"can reduce complexity, improve performance, and better allocate resources"
" to enhance the product. This change helps ensure more consistent, "
"robust, and scalable database interactions for all Mattermost "
"deployments."

msgid "Is migrating to PostgreSQL before upgrading Mattermost recommended?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deploy/postgres-migration.rst:31
msgid ""
"Yes. We also recommend upgrading to Mattermost server v8.x or later "
"before migrating to PostgreSQL."

msgid "Can the migration-assist be run on the Mattermost server?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deploy/postgres-migration.rst:36
msgid ""
"Technically, yes. The ``migration-assist`` tool can be run on the "
"Mattermost server. However, it is recommended to run the tool on a "
"separate server to avoid any performance issues. We advise running the "
"migration against a copy of the MySQL database to ensure that the "
"migration process does not impact the production environment."

msgid "How large should the PostgreSQL server be?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deploy/postgres-migration.rst:41
msgid ""
"The size of the PostgreSQL server should match that of the MySQL server "

msgid "How large should the server running ``migration-assist`` server be?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deploy/postgres-migration.rst:46
msgid ""
"The tool itself is lightweight and does not require a large server. A "
"server with 2 CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM should be sufficient for default"
" configurations. However, you may need to adjust the resources based on "
"the size of the MySQL database, your downtime limitations, and the "
"configuration of ``pgloader``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/deploy/postgres-migration.rst:66
msgid ""
"Mattermost does not support MariaDB. The primary reason for this decision"
" is to streamline development and maintenance by focusing on a single "
"database technology. By standardizing on PostgreSQL, Mattermost can "
"deliver optimized features, improved performance, and a more focused "
