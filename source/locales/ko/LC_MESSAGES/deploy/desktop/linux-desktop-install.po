"The GPG public key has changed. If you had previously set up the "
"repository on your system, you'll need to `download the new key "
"<https://deb.packages.mattermost.com/pubkey.gpg>`_. You can set the "
"``UPDATE_GPG_KEY=yes`` environment variable when running the setup script"
" to configure it to overwrite the previous key on your system with the "
"new one. The first step of installation then becomes: ``curl -fsS -o- "
"https://deb.packages.mattermost.com/setup-repo.sh | sudo "
"UPDATE_GPG_KEY=yes bash``. Depending on your setup, additional steps may "
"also be required, particularly for installations that don't rely on the "
"repository setup script."
