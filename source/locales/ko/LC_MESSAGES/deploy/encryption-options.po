msgid ""
"In a High Availability mode, Mattermost supports encryption of cluster "
"data in-transit when using the gossip protocol, which is based on "
"principles outlined in the `SWIM protocol developed by researchers at "
"Cornell University "
"<https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public_pdfs/SWIM.pdf>`_."
" The gossip protocol is a communication mechanism in distributed systems "
"where nodes randomly exchange information to ensure data consistency "
"across the network. It is decentralized, scalable, and fault-tolerant, "
"making it ideal for systems with numerous nodes. Information is spread in"
" a manner similar to social gossip, with nodes periodically \"gossiping\""
" updates to random peers until the network converges to a consistent "
"state. Widely used in distributed databases, blockchain networks, and "
"peer-to-peer systems, the protocol is simple to implement and resilient "
"to node failures. However, it can suffer from redundancy and propagation "
"delays in large networks."

"The encryption uses AES-256 by default, and it is not configurable. "
"However, it is possible to manually set the value in the ``Systems`` "
"table for the ``ClusterEncryptionKey`` row. A key is a byte array "
"converted to base64. It can be set to a length of 16, 24, or 32 bytes to "
"select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256 respectively."
