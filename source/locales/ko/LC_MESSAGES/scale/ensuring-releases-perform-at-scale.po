"To ensure each release of Mattermost upholds our high standards for "
"performance at scale, the Mattermost Engineering team performs thorough "
"load testing, develops features with scale in mind, and follows strict "
"guidelines for database schema migrations."

"Each month, before being approved for distribution, a release candidate "
"of Mattermost is load tested via a comprehensive and mature set of `load "
"test tooling <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-load-test-ng>`__ "
"using simulated data that matches real-world, high-scale usage patterns."

"Multiple tests covering different configurations are run against highly-"
"available deployments of Mattermost with thousands of users and millions "
"of posts. Both PostgreSQL and MySQL are tested, although MySQL tests will"
" be dropped when :ref:`MySQL goes out of support with Mattermost v11 "

"The load tests generate a report detailing average API request times, "
"database I/O, memory usage, concurrency, requests per second, and more. "
"This performance report on the release candidate is then compared to the "

"investigated and remedied before the release candidate is promoted to the"
" final release."

"After a new version of Mattermost is released, it is rolled out to "
