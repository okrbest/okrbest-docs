"`Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co>`__ provides enterprise-scale "
"deployments with optimized search performance and prevents performance "
"degradation and timeouts. Elasticsearch allows you to search large "
"volumes of data quickly, in near real-time, by creating and managing an "
"index of post data. Mattermost’s implementation uses `Elasticsearch "
"<https://www.elastic.co>`_ as a distributed, RESTful search engine "
"supporting highly efficient database searches in a :doc:`cluster "
"environment </scale/high-availability-cluster-based-deployment>`. Visit "
"the :doc:`Mattermost Elasticsearch product documentation "
"</scale/elasticsearch>` for deployment and configuration details."

"Performance monitoring support enables a Mattermost server to track "
"system health for large Enterprise deployments through integrations with "
"`Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`__ and `Grafana "
"<https://grafana.com/>`__. These integrations support data collection "
"from several Mattermost servers, which is particularly useful if you’re "
"running Mattermost :doc:`in high availability mode </scale/high-"
"availability-cluster-based-deployment>`. Once you’re tracking system "
"health, you can :doc:`set up performance alerts </scale/performance-"
"alerting>` on your Grafana dashboard. Visit the :doc:`Mattermost "
"Performance Monitoring product documentation </scale/deploy-prometheus-"
"grafana-for-performance-monitoring>` for installation details."
