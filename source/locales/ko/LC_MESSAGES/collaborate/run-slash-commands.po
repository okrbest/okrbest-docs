"Mattermost slash commands offer an alternate way to perform tasks and "
"actions in Mattermost. Slash commands are often preferred by developers "
"and technical audiences because of how fast they are to use, and how "
"similar they are to a developer's daily coding tools."

"Using a slash command is as easy as composing a message; however, instead"
" of message text, you start slash commands with a slash character: ``/``."
" For example, if you want to log out of Mattermost using only your "
"keyboard, you can enter ``/logout`` in the message text box and select "
"**Send**. Because your message starts with a slash ``/``, Mattermost "
"knows it's a slash command, and performs the action defined for that "
"command."
