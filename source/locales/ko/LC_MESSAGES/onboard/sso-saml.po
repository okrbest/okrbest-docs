"Single sign-on (SSO) is a way for users to log into multiple applications"
" with a single user ID and password without having to re-enter their "
"credentials. The SAML standard allows identity providers to pass "
"credentials to service providers. Mattermost can be configured to act as "
"a SAML 2.0 Service Provider."

"Mattermost can be configured to act as a SAML 2.0 Service Provider, and "

"In addition to the officially supported identity providers, you can also "
"configure SAML for a custom IdP. For instance, customers have "
"successfully set up miniOrange, Azure AD, DUO, PingFederate, Keycloak, "
"and SimpleSAMLphp as custom IdPs. Because we do not test against these "
"identity providers, it is important that you test new versions of "
"Mattermost in a staging environment to confirm it will work with your "
"identity provider. You can also set up MFA on top of your SAML provider "
"for additional security."
