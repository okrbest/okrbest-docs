"**On demand:** If user accounts are not pre-provisioned using one of the "
"methods described below, then a new user account will be provisioned when"
" the user first logs in. When the user logs in, they are asked to select "
"a public team to join (all users must belong to at least one team) and "
"then they are added automatically to the Town Square channel. Mattermost "
"also has a :ref:`default channel setting <configure/experimental-"
"configuration-settings:default channels>` that enables system admins to "
"add everyone to additional channels specified by the organization."

"**Pre-provisioned via bulk import:** Mattermost features a :doc:`bulk "
"data loading tool </onboard/bulk-loading-data>` that can be used for pre-"
"provisioning new users by adding them to teams and channels before their "
"first login to Mattermost. This tool automates the creation of Teams, "
"Channels, Users, and Posts (with file attachments). It can also be used "
"to migrate users and content from an existing system."
