"The free version of Mattermost is intended for approximately 50 users. If"
" your Mattermost materially exceeds this recommended size, system admins "
"should seek to either `purchase a commercial license "

"subscription </about/non-profit-subscriptions>` license. Alternatively, "
"admins can :ref:`deactivate users <configure/user-management-"
