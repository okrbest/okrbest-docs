"Mattermostâ€™s feature labels serve as indicators of the status, maturity, "
"and support level of each feature, helping users and system "
"administrators navigate product feature adoption with clarity and "
"confidence. Feature labels communicate the stage of development, level of"
" readiness, and potential risks associated with a feature for customers "
"seeking to adopt new value."

"Feature is an early Proof of Concept (POC) with an unstable codebase, "
"minimal QA covering a small or specific set of use cases, and potential "
"UI issues. Security reviews are incomplete, making it unsuitable for "
"production. Distribution of the solution is limited, and our Cloud "
"environments are typically not eligible to use experimental features. "
"Data loss can occur as data schemas and configurations may change, and "
"minimal documentation is available. Caution is advised as the solution "
"may be discarded if its value is not proven."

"Feature is in active development towards General Availability. Not fully "
"complete, but reviewed by our security team, adoption is suitable for a "
"small set of customers behind a feature flag. Identified bugs are fixed "
"on a best effort basis, and no major breaking changes are anticipated, "
"full testing is in progress, and detailed documentation may not be "
"available. Beta is a transitional stage, meaning the solution is maturing"
" but requires careful consideration in a full production deployment as "
"scale and client availability may vary. `Premier Support "
"<https://mattermost.com/support/>`__ is recommended when using beta "
"features in production environments."

"Feature has undergone thorough validation and testing and has production-"
"level quality. It is feature-complete, meets quality standards, has "
"successfully passed security reviews, and has detailed product "
"documentation available. General Availability features are suitable for "
"widespread production deployment and adoption, and are eligible for "
"commercial support, as they offer stability and reliability, with no "
"expected changes that could disrupt functionality or scalability."

"Feature is officially marked for removal from the product. It is no "
"longer supported or actively maintained by the development team. If the "
"feature is still in use in your deployed version, we recommend users "
"discontinue its use and migrate to alternative functionalities."
