"While you're welcome to use the Mattermost source code under its open "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:21
msgid "A webhook is a way for one app to send real-time data to another app."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:23
msgid ""
"In Mattermost, incoming webhooks receive data from external applications "
"and make a post in a specified channel. They're great for setting up "
"notifications that are sent into a Mattermost channel when something "
"happens in an external application."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:25
msgid ""
"Outgoing webhooks are triggered based on a rule in Mattermost and takes "
"data (the message, and some contextual info) from Mattermost and send it "
"to an external application. The receiving server of the outgoing webhook "
"can then post a response back in Mattermost. They're great for listening "
"for a specific word, and then notifying external applications when a "
"trigger word is used."

msgid "What's a slash command?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:30
msgid ""
"A slash command is similar to an outgoing webhook, but instead of "
"listening to a channel it is used as a command tool. This means if you "
"type in a slash command it will not be posted to a channel, whereas an "
"outgoing webhook is only triggered by posted messages."

msgid "What does Slack-compatible mean?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:35
msgid ""
"Slack compatible means that Mattermost accepts integrations that have a "
"payload in the same format as Slack's legacy \"Message Attachment\" "
"payload. If you have a Slack integration, you should be able to set it up"
" in Mattermost without changing the format of the message being sent "
"over."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:38
msgid "What if I have a webhook from somewhere other than Slack?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:40
msgid ""
"If you have an integration that outputs a payload in a different format, "
"you need to write an intermediate application, such as N8N.io, Zapier, or"
" Integromat, to act as a translation layer to change it to the format "
"Mattermost uses. Since thereâ€™s currently no general standard for webhook "
"formatting, this is unavoidable and just a part of how webhooks work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:42
msgid ""
"If there's no translation layer, Mattermost won't understand the data "
"you're sending."

msgid "What are attachments?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:47
msgid ""
"When \"attachments\" are mentioned in Mattermost integrations "
"documentation, it refers to Slack's message attachments functionality. "
"These \"attachments\" can be optionally added as an array in the data "
"sent by an integration, and are used to customize the formatting of the "
"message."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:49

"Mattermost doesn't currently support the ability to attach files to a "
"post made via webhook. You can use the API to attach files to a message "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-integrations.rst:61
msgid ""
"For self-hosted deployments in small setups, you might host integrations "
"on the same server on which Mattermost is installed. For larger "
"deployments, you can set up a separate server for integrations, or add "
"them to the server on which the external application is hosted. For "
"example, if you're self-hosting a Jira server you could deploy a Jira "
"integration on the Jira server itself. When self-hosting restrictions are"
" less strict, AWS, Heroku, and other public cloud options could also be "
"used."
