"Mattermost provides a variety of methods to add functionality and "

"an advanced chatbot, or completely change the functionality of your "
"server."

"For self-hosted deployments in small setups, you might host integrations "
"on the same server on which Mattermost is installed. For larger "
"deployments, you can set up a separate server for integrations, or add "
"them to the server on which the external application is hosted. For "
"example, if you’re self-hosting a Jira server, you could deploy a Jira "
"integration on the Jira server itself. When self-hosting restrictions are"
" less strict, AWS, Heroku, and other public cloud options can also be "
"used."

"A webhook is a way for one app to send real-time data to another app. In "
"Mattermost, `incoming webhooks "
"<https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/webhooks/incoming/>`_ "
"receive data from external applications and make a post in a specified "
"channel. They’re great for setting up notifications when something "
"happens in an external application."

"`Outgoing webhooks "
"<https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/webhooks/outgoing/>`_ take "
"data from Mattermost, and send it to an external application. Then the "
"outgoing webhook can post a response back in Mattermost. They’re great "
"for listening in on channels, and then notifying external applications "
"when a trigger word is used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/integrations.rst:31
msgid ""
"Mattermost webhooks are \"Slack-compatible”. This means that Mattermost "
"accepts integrations that have a payload in the same format as Slack. In "
"an application that already supports Slack webhooks, you can replace the "
"Slack webhook URL with a Mattermost webhook URL and the integration will "
"“just work”."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/integrations.rst:33
msgid ""
"If you have an integration that outputs a payload in a different format, "
"you need to write an intermediate application to act as a translation "
"layer to change it to the format Mattermost uses. Since there’s currently"
" no general standard for webhook formatting, this is unavoidable and just"
" a part of how webhooks work."
