msgid ""
"Mattermost Enterprise and Mattermost Professional licenses are sold as "

"System Console and activate and deactivate registered users at any time. "

"**Technical Scaling:** Whether used for teams or enterprises, the "
"Mattermost server is designed to support tens of thousands of users on a "
"single server with appropriate hardware. The server is built using "
"Golang, the language developed by Google to create internet-scale "
"applications, and supports highly scalable databases. Beyond tens of "
"thousands of users, Mattermost Enterprise Edition can offer high "
"availability cluster-based/horizontal scaling configurations using "
"multiple servers to support even larger organizations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-enterprise.rst:74
msgid ""
"**Functional Scaling:** Scaling from a team to an enterprise is like "
"going from a \"virtual office\" to a \"virtual campus\". Advanced "
"features like enterprise authentication, granular permissions, compliance"
" and auditing, and advanced reporting become increasingly important as "
"organizations grow beyond teams. Organizations needing this flexibility "
"can easily upgrade from Mattermost Team Edition to Mattermost Enterprise "
"Edition as well as downgrade without data loss, should their needs "
"change."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-enterprise.rst:81
msgid ""
"For a small deployment of Mattermost up to a few hundred users, we'd "
"recommend a part-time, mid-level IT admin with a senior IT admin for "
"supervision and as a backup resource. They should have the ability to "
"administer a basic Linux server, a PostgreSQL database, and web proxy "
"configuration with web sockets."
msgstr ""

"For a medium deployment of 500 to 2000 users, we'd recommend a senior IT "

"Availability cluster-based deployment with redundant database and "

"Our customers address multiple collaboration solutions in different ways "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-enterprise.rst:90
msgid ""
"**For top-down, customers want to simplify and leverage investments in a "
"central, flexible, innovative solution that can scale.** There's "
"generally a lot of pain with different teams and departments running "
"their own messaging tools, creating silos, redundancy, and significant "
"productivity loss. They'll roll out Mattermost as an official solution "
"and centralize communication there. Visit the `Mattermost customers page "
"<https://mattermost.com/customers/>`_ for examples."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/faq-enterprise.rst:92
msgid ""
"**For bottom-up, customers want to supplement for strategic advantage.** "
"We've seen teams flock to Mattermost because of its productivity benefits"
" for DevOps, remote work, rapid response, and scaling large teams where "
"people are overloaded with email. Those organizations, which can have "
"hundreds to thousands of users, will use Mattermost in parallel with "
"general-purpose messaging that doesn't meet their specific needs."

"One example is Wargaming, one of the world's largest real-time online "
"video game operators, with over 150 million players on their system. "
"They've moved their DevOps, design, analytics and support teams to "
"Mattermost to supplement Skype for Business. This is their company-wide, "
"general-purpose messenger that isn't optimized for large DevOps "
"organizations and the degree of integration and flexibility they need - "
"specifically for DevOps. People want support for Linux and Mac desktops, "
"lots of APIs and hooks to integrate. They also need help for plugins to "
"embed certain types of reports and interactive controls into messages, "
"friendly keyboard shortcuts, and dozens of other enhancements that "
"provide a distinct advantage to their counterparts at other companies."
