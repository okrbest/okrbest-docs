"For example, the Mattermost server source code is and always has been "

"If you run a fork of the Mattermost server, we highly recommend you only "

"release security update patches when reports of new attacks are received "
"and verified. Mattermost waits until 14 days after a security patch is "
"released before publicly detailing its nature so that users and customers"
" can upgrade before the security vulnerability is widely known. A "
"malicious user can potentially make use of Mattermost security "
"disclosures to exploit a fork of Mattermost if the security upgrade is "
"not promptly incorporated into the forked version."
