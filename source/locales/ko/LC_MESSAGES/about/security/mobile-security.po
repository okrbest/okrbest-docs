"Mattermost mobile applications can be operated under the protection of "
"mobile access platforms like `Hypori <https://www.hypori.com/>`_. These "
"platforms provide an additional layer of security by creating a "
"virtualized environment for mobile applications, ensuring that sensitive "
"data is isolated from the device's operating system. This approach "
"enhances data protection and minimizes the risk of data leakage or "
"unauthorized access."

msgid ""
"Jailbreaking or rooting a device disables many built-in security "
"measures, making the device prone to malware and unauthorized access. "
"This protection enables Mattermost administrators to deny access from any"
" mobile device that appears to have been tampered with or is running a "
"non-standard version of the operating system. Additionally, a rooted "
"device may stop checking for software updates and security patches, and "
"it might not be able to install them because the kernel is no longer "
"properly signed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/security/mobile-security.rst:33
msgid ""
"By detecting such devices, Mattermost ensures that only secure, "
"uncompromised devices can access sensitive data. When enabled by the "
"system admin, this proactive measure ensures the underlying mobile "
"platform operates reliably and performs the expected kernel and operating"
" system security protections before sending any customer data to the "
"Mattermost application, and minimizes risk in environments where personal"
" device security cannot be guaranteed. Learn more about Mattermost "

"Native biometric authentication ensures only the authorized device owner "
"can access the Mattermost application. By utilizing hardware-level "
"security, biometrics significantly enhance data protection, especially in"
" cases of lost or stolen devices. This advanced security measure is far "
"more robust and user-friendly compared to traditional passwords, adding a"
" resilient layer of protection against unauthorized access."

"Preventing screenshots and screen recordings protects sensitive "

"is essential in ensuring that confidential communications and data remain"
" within the secure confines of the app. By blocking unauthorized screen "
"captures, Mattermost significantly reduces the risk of data leakage via "
"visual content by preventing users from taking screenshots or recording "
"their screens on the mobile device. This feature ensures that users can "
"not intentionally or inadvertently capture an image of any information "
