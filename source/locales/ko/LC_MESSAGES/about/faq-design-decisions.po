"Why does Mattermost disclose whether or not an account exists when a user"
" enters an incorrect password?"

"Mattermost's core design principle is to be \"fast, obvious, forgiving\" "
"and, telling users that they made a mistake in entering their password, "
"is in service of our principle of prioritizing user interests."

"When using username-password authentication, especially with AD/LDAP, "
"there's the possibility of usernames being email addresses, Mattermost "
"username, AD/LDAP username and ID, or other AD/LDAP attributes and our "
"design principle intends to help end users understand whether their login"
" error came from having the wrong password or the wrong email/username."

"We believe this design increases productivity, speeds up user adoption, "
"and reduces help desk tickets and support costs - and that these benefits"
" outweigh the trade-offs."

"The trade-off with this design is that if physical security is not in "
"effect, network security is not in effect (i.e., no VPN or a malicious "
"user within the private network), and username-password authentication is"
" used, an attacker may be able to enumerate email addresses or usernames "
"by sending HTTP requests to the system, up to the maximum number of "
"requests per second defined in Mattermost's :doc:`API rate limiting "
"settings </configure/environment-configuration-settings>`."

"For organizations who choose to deploy in such a configuration, please "

"Instead of username-password, use a Single Sign-On (SSO) provider in "
"Mattermost Enterprise Edition like OneLogin, Okta, or ADFS, or use the "
"open source GitLab SSO option available with Mattermost Team Edition."
