"With Skype for Business reaching end-of-life, security-conscious "
"organizations face a critical inflection point. Many operate in air-"
"gapped or classified environments where cloud-based alternatives are not "
"viable due to compliance restrictions, risk exposure, or data sovereignty"
" mandates. Without a secure, modern, on-premises collaboration platform, "
"these organizations risk operational disruption, mission misalignment, "
"and non-compliance with stringent regulatory frameworks."

"Mattermost provides a secure, self-hosted communication and collaboration"
" platform purpose-built for air-gapped environments, classified networks,"

"DISA STIG compliance requirements, Mattermost replaces legacy tools with "
"modern capabilities—secure messaging, file sharing, workflow automation, "
"and integrated video collaboration—while maintaining full enterprise "
"control. Organizations can operate at scale, enable external "
"collaboration without policy violations, and modernize their digital "
