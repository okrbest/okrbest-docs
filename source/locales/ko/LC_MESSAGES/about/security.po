"Mattermost offers a comprehensive set of security features to protect "
"information in its mobile applications. These features, ranging from "
"encryption and authentication to device management and user education, "
"provide a secure environment for team collaboration and communication. By"

"Mattermost can be configured to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to "
