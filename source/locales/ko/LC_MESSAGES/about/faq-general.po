"The :ref:`commercial version of Mattermost <about/editions-and-"
"offerings:mattermost enterprise edition>` is designed to never lock-in "
"your data. Portions of the commercial version are shared with the "
":ref:`open source version <about/editions-and-offerings:mattermost team "

"Our largest contractual obligation is for over a quarter of a million "

"We have done performance testing of 60,000 concurrent users and 60 "

"factor of between 10 to 1 and 3 to 1, depending on the distribution of an"
" organization across time zones. Peak concurrent usage in a single "

#: ../../source/about/faq-general.rst:31
msgid ""
"The open source Mattermost Team Edition is functionally identical to the "

"We generally recommend installing Enterprise Edition, even if you don't "
"currently need a license. This provides the flexibility to unlock "
"Enterprise features seamlessly should you need them. However, if you only"
" want to install software with a fully open source code base, then Team "
"Edition is the best choice for you."

"To deploy the Team Edition, download the :doc:`Mattermost Team Edition "
