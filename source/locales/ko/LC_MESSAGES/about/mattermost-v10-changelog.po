"System Console statistics now perform faster on PostgreSQL. The "

"value is no longer needed to disable the other queries since they are "

"plugin data, are now hidden until clicked, reducing load time. No "
"performance improvements apply to MySQL since it's scheduled for full "
"deprecation in v11. We recommend migrating to PostgreSQL for better "

"The internal workings of the `PluginLinkComponent` in the web app have "
"been changed to unmount link tooltips from the DOM by default, "
"significantly improving performance. Plugins that register link tooltips "
"using `registerLinkTooltipComponent` will experience changes in how "
"tooltip components are managed—they are now only mounted when a link is "
"hovered over or focused. As a result, plugins may need to update their "
"components to properly handle mounting and unmounting scenarios. For "
"example, changes were made in [mattermost-plugin-"
"jira](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-jira/pull/1145), "
"where componentDidUpdate lifecycle hook was replaced with "
"componentDidMount. If your plugin’s tooltip component is a functional "
"React component, there is a high chance that this behavior will be "
"handled automatically, as it would be managed by useEffect with an empty "
"dependency array."
