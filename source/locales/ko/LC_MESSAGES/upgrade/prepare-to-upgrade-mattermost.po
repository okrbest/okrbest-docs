"Mattermost will aim to have non-locking, backwards-compatible migrations "

"last ESR version. For example, if there are three ESR versions ESR1, "
"ESR2, and ESR3, upgrading from ESR1 to ESR2, and then ESR2 to ESR3 will "
"ensure backwards compatibility, but not from ESR1 to ESR3 directly."

"In the case of delayed upgrades, we recommend upgrading to the closest "
