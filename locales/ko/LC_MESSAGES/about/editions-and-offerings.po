"As the platform matures and new features are added, they're evaluated to "
"be included in the plan that best aligns with the organizational use "
"cases outlined by the editions above. Multiple factors are considered in "
"determining the appropriate plan to include a feature including mission-"
"critical impact, relative value to a single team, cross-functional teams,"

"We recognize there aren't any features that are only useful to managers, "
"directors, and executives. Individual practitioners may want certain "
"features; however, we think that other buyers are relatively more likely "
"to care about it. We also recognize that there may be some features that "
"are put into an edition to find later there is much demand for it by "
"individuals or a singular team; we will not hesitate to move that "
"feature. We value feedback from our community and iterate based on that "
"feedback. Simultaneously, we also need to offer commercial products that "
"hold value and do our best to find the right balance. We believe the more"
" of Mattermost that you use, the more likely it is that you benefit from "
"the advanced editions we offer."
