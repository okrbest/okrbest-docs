"field type of Data in model.ClusterMessage was changed to []byte from "

"incompatible to run along with a v5 server in a cluster. Customers "
"upgrading from 5.x to 6.x cannot do a High Availability upgrade. While "
"upgrading, it is required that no other v5 server runs when a v6 server "
"is brought up. A v6 server will run significant database schema changes "
"that can cause a large startup time depending on the dataset size. Zero "
"downtime will not be possible, but depending on the efforts made during "
"the migration process, it can be minimized to a large extent. It is "
"recommended to start Mattermost directly and not through systemctl to "
"avoid the server process getting killed during the migration. This can "
"happen since the value of ``TimeoutStartSec`` in the provided systemctl "
"service file is set to 1 hour. Customers using the Mattermost Kubernetes "
"operator should be aware of the above migration information and choose "
"the path that is most appropriate for them. If (1) is acceptable, then "

"``ClusterSettings``. If this is set to ``true``, and "
"``UseExperimentalGossip`` is also ``true``, all communication through the"
" cluster using the gossip protocol will be encrypted. The encryption uses"
" ``AES-256`` by default, and it is not kept configurable by design. "
"However, if one wishes, they can set the value in Systems table manually "
"for the ``ClusterEncryptionKey`` row. A key is a byte array converted to "
"base64. It should be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes to select AES-128, "
"AES-192, or AES-256. To update the key, one can execute ``UPDATE Systems "
"SET Value='<value>' WHERE Name='ClusterEncryptionKey';`` in MySQL and "
"``UPDATE systems SET value='<value>' WHERE name='ClusterEncryptionKey'`` "
"for PostgreSQL. For any change in this config setting to take effect, the"
" whole cluster must be shutdown first. Then the config change made, and "
"then restarted. In a cluster, all servers either will completely use "
"encryption or not. There cannot be any partial usage."
