"A source available license gives access to source code, but places "

"free-of-charge and unrestricted use of the source code in development and"
" testing environments, but requires a valid Mattermost Enterprise Edition"
" License in a production environment."

"When the Mattermost Source Available ``LICENSE`` file appears at the root"
