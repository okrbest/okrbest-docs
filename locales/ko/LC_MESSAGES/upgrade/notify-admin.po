"If access to a feature requires a plan upgrade, system admins receive "
"notifications of these requests in order to collect data before "
"upgrading. For example, if only one end-user requests access to AD/LDAP, "
"it probably isn't necessary to upgrade. However, if 20 users, including "
"team and channel admins request it, you may want to consider upgrading to"
" support this need."
