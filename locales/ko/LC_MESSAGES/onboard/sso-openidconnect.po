"At this time, LDAP data isn't compatible with OpenID. If you currently "

"attributes, you won't be able to do this automatically with users who "
"have logged in with OpenID. If you need LDAP synced to each user, we "
"suggest using SAML or LDAP as the login provider. Some OpenID providers "
"can use SAML instead, like Keycloak."
